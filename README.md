# Bounded-MST

This solver takes as input a set of degree-bounded nodes and a set of undirected, weighted edges, and outputs the lowest-cost degree-bounded minimum spanning tree. This is an NP-Complete problem, so three algorithms were modified and used for this project: Kruskal's, Prim's, and Linear Programming. Tested against a standardized set of solutions, half the outputs correctly computed the number of edges in the MST at a cost equal to or even lower than the solutions. 

# Usage
The three solvers are located in /src
Solver generated outputs are in /samples
Test inputs are in /test
